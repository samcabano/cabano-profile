## About Me

<img src="portfolio.jpg" align="left" style="margin: 10px"> 

First off, you can call me Sam! I am a student and healthcare worker with a passion for health, research, and human-computer interaction. 

The most important thing in my life is improving myself and the daily lives of those around me, by means of education and encouragement. 

I pride myself on the energy and dedication I bring to each new project I take on, regardless of the field. 

An interesting thing about me is I love travelling, cats, and coffee!

## IT75 - Python for Many Uses
I am taking this class because Python is a popular programming language in research labs in the Cognitive Science field. While my primary goal is to become a healthcare provider, I understand people change their careers on an average of 7 times in their life! One career path I may entertain is research or computer programming. Also, I love learning new things, and enjoy programming. This class will be a nice break from chemistry and biology!

I honestly believe there is not much that will prevent me from doing well in this class because I have the determination to succeed. The only thing that could prevent me from doing well is an unplanned emergency.
